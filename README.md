## Insights 
- With 10,000 total orders and total sales of $2.3 million dollars, a profit margin of 12% was made over a four years period.
- The west was the best performing region with $108,000 in profits - more than twice that of the Central region which accounted for the region with the least profits.
- Consumer good generated the most profits while Home office accounted for the least profits.
- Customers preferred using the standard class mode of shipping.
- using the interactive slicers, office supplies category accounted for more than 60% of total orders but made less profits than the technology category which had just 20% of total orders.
- The West generated the most supplies from office supplies and furniture while the East genrated the most profits from Technology. The Central region made losses from furniture sales.
- From the trend of profits, recurring peaks and dips in profit are observed annually especially in Q4.

## Recommendations
- Focus more resources and marketing efforts in the West, which consistently outperforms other region in terms of profits.
- the East region's success with Technology products should be studied so as to replicate similar strategies across other regions.
- Investigate the central region to determine why profits are low especially for furniture category. Conduct a feedback analysis to pinpoint the problem sourec. Marketing strategies can also be tailored to specific products.
